Villa Management System Project
This project is a web application that provides a digital platform for managing villas. Admin users can view, modify villa data, and manage the system. The project has been developed using ASP.NET Core and MongoDB.
Project Structure and Technology Stack
Backend
ASP.NET Core: A Web API-based solution has been created, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and RESTful API principles.

MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides a highly flexible schema for data storage and querying.

JWT Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication and authorization of admin users.

ASP.NET Core Identity: ASP.NET Core Identity is used for handling authentication of only admin users.

Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The user interface has been developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it is responsive for both mobile and desktop devices.

React.js (optional): For frontend development, React.js or other modern JavaScript frameworks could be used (optional).

Database
MongoDB: MongoDB is used for data storage. It allows flexible schema modeling with JSON-like structures for the stored data.

MongoDB C# Driver: The official C# driver for MongoDB is used to interact with the database.

Project Features
1. Admin User Management
Admin Registration Only: In the system, only admin users can register and log in. Authentication for the admin user is securely handled using ASP.NET Core Identity.

JWT Token: Once an admin user logs in, they receive a JWT token that is used for each request. Each API request is validated using this token.

Password Security: Admin passwords are securely stored using a hashing algorithm.

2. Admin Management
Admin Panel: Admin users can manage all villa data. They can add, update, or delete villa entries.

Villa Management: Villa information is stored in MongoDB using flexible data structures. Each villa includes details such as name, price, description, features, and images.

3. Villa Data
CRUD Operations: Admins can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on villa entries. Each villa is stored with a flexible schema in MongoDB.
