Villa Management System Project
Welcome to the Villa Management System â€“ an innovative web application designed to seamlessly manage villas. This platform provides admin users with full control over villa data, allowing them to effortlessly view, modify, and manage various aspects of the system. Built using ASP.NET Core and MongoDB, this project offers scalability and flexibility to meet future needs.

Project Structure & Technology Stack
Backend
ASP.NET Core: A robust, high-performance Web API solution, structured around the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and following RESTful API principles for optimal maintainability and scalability.

MongoDB: A powerful NoSQL database used for dynamic and flexible data storage. MongoDB enables easy modification and retrieval of villa data, making it an ideal choice for rapidly evolving applications.

JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication is achieved using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Admin users receive a token upon login, ensuring secure, token-based access to API endpoints.

ASP.NET Core Identity: A comprehensive system to handle user authentication, ensuring that only admin users can register, log in, and access sensitive information.

Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The user interface is crafted with clean, modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Responsive design principles ensure the platform provides a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

React.js (Optional): Although the primary UI is built with basic frontend technologies, React.js (or other modern JavaScript frameworks) can be implemented to enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.

Database
MongoDB: The data storage solution of choice, MongoDB allows for schema flexibility, making it possible to handle complex data models with ease. This is especially useful for managing dynamic villa data such as images, prices, and features.

MongoDB C# Driver: The official driver enables smooth integration between the backend API and MongoDB, providing efficient and reliable database operations.

Project Features
1. Admin User Management
Exclusive Admin Registration: The system is designed exclusively for admin users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and modify villa data. Admin authentication is handled securely using ASP.NET Core Identity.

JWT-Based Authentication: After successful login, admin users are provided with a secure JWT token, which is used for authenticating subsequent requests to the API, ensuring security and scalability.

Encrypted Password Storage: Admin credentials are stored securely using advanced hashing algorithms, offering robust protection against unauthorized access.

2. Admin Management Panel
Comprehensive Admin Panel: The central hub for admin users to manage every aspect of the villa data. From adding new villas to updating or removing existing ones, admins have complete control over villa listings.

Efficient Villa Management: Villa data is stored in MongoDB using flexible data structures, allowing admins to easily update details like the villa name, price, description, features, and images. This flexibility ensures that the system can scale as the platform grows.

3. Villa Data Management
Seamless CRUD Operations: Admins can perform full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on villa entries. Each villa's details are stored in a flexible, scalable manner, allowing the system to evolve as new features and data types are added.
